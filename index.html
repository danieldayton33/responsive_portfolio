        <p>
            I was born in NY, but have grown up in Raleigh, NC. I have recently switched tracks to pursue a career in web development. Until recently, I was running a small farm, Old Milburnie Farm, on the Raleigh/Knightdale border.
            Farming has been my lifetime passion. I began working towards owning my own farm in high school. Old Milburnie Farm has grown into a prosperous business that is very much a part of the Raleigh food scene. However, farming is 
            a tough business and personally I'm ready for a new challenge. My goal in pursuing a career in web development, once I gain several years of experience, is to one day create a web tool that can help the farming community. Connecting with 
            customers has become the biggest hinderance to my farm business. The farmers' market boom that resulted from a lack of quality produce and meats at grocery stores in the late 90s and early 2000s, has been curbed by several factors: improved product in groceries,
            increase in home delivery services, online market places for organic produce, and the overall malaise of the millennials to get out of bed on a Saturday morning. I think a new webtool that connects farmers to consumers would be instrumental in increasing the 
            sustainability of small farms. Old Milburnie Farm continues on, but with my role diminished. I hope to supplement my income with web development to support the business and improve our direct market visibility.
Also, I love my wife, Sarah Deasy. The picture is her and I on our wedding day in our greenhouse!
